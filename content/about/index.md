Hi 👋, I'm Lukas, a nearly-graduated CS student with a passion for HomeLab, 3D printing and the occiasional DIY project. Beyond that, I am currently developing [InventoryHero](https://github.com/InventoryHero/InventoryHero), which started as a university project but has since become a fun, hands-on learning experience for building real-world applications (also I am using it myself to keep track of, well my inventory).

This blog will feature a collection of random insights, tips, and updates on my work with HomeLab, 3D printing, and software development. Occasionally, there might even be a cat post (no promises, though! 😉).
