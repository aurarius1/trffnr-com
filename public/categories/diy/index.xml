      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago I received an iPhone 6s from a friend who couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember their iCloud password and since it was a 6s decided they didn’t want to bother with it anymore.. So the question then was what to do with it, of course keeping it for spare parts was an option, but since it was such an old phone I needed something better as it would mostly just collect dust waiting to donate some of its internals. After digging around online, I found the perfect answer: teardown art. Not only would it give new life to the old device, but I’d also end up with a unique piece of art for my home. Basically, the phone is disassembled into its pieces and then put on a nice template describing each part.  To really make this look good though it should be noted that the phone shouldn&amp;rsquo;t show visible defects/marks and should still have the original battery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
