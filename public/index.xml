      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the recent (or not so recent) BambuLab anniversary sale, I decided to buy a P1S. At the beginning, I was very unsure about buying it with the AMS or without, it is a lot of money for a hobby nevertheless. As my university time nears its end (currently just my Master Thesis is left to do) I decided to &amp;ldquo;reward&amp;rdquo; myself with the AMS on top of it - and luckily so.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;who-am-i&#34;&gt;Who am I&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hi, my name is Lukas, 24 years old and at the time of writing I am a CS masters student. I want to start this blog to share my enthusiuasm for various diy projects (though most of them probably will evolve around 3d printing or homelabing).&#xA;Maybe once or twice there will also be a little coding (maybe microcontroller based stuff, though I am not very expierenced with that). Mostly I see this as an opportunity to learn myself and share what I do for fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi 👋, I&amp;rsquo;m Lukas, a nearly-graduated CS student with a passion for HomeLab, 3D printing and the occiasional DIY project. Beyond that, I am currently developing &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/InventoryHero/InventoryHero&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34;&#xA;  class=&#34;inline-flex items-center gap-1&#34;&#xA;&gt;InventoryHero&#xA;  &lt;svg id=&#34;external-link&#34; class=&#34;h-3 w-3 flex-shrink-0&#34;&#xA;    fill=&#34;none&#34;&#xA;    stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34;&#xA;    viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34;&gt;&lt;path fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34; d=&#34;M15 3h6v6m-11 5L21 3m-3 10v6a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V8a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h6&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&#xA;&lt;/a&gt;, which started as a university project but has since become a fun, hands-on learning experience for building real-world applications (also I am using it myself to keep track of, well my inventory).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
