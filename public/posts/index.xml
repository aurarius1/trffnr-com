      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the recent (or not so recent) BambuLab anniversary sale, I decided to buy a P1S. At the beginning, I was very unsure about buying it with the AMS or without, it is a lot of money for a hobby nevertheless. As my university time nears its end (currently just my Master Thesis is left to do) I decided to &amp;ldquo;reward&amp;rdquo; myself with the AMS on top of it - and luckily so.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;who-am-i&#34;&gt;Who am I&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hi, my name is Lukas, 24 years old and at the time of writing I am a CS masters student. I want to start this blog to share my enthusiuasm for various diy projects (though most of them probably will evolve around 3d printing or homelabing).&#xA;Maybe once or twice there will also be a little coding (maybe microcontroller based stuff, though I am not very expierenced with that). Mostly I see this as an opportunity to learn myself and share what I do for fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
