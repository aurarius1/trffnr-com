      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post will be mostly about 3d printing air quality and especially air safety. Before starting I want to mention that I am no professional (far from it to be honest), I&amp;rsquo;m just a hobbyist focused on making my setup as safe as possible - so read the next lines with caution and do not take this as medical / health advice or anything more than a random blog post on the internet. As my two 3d printers are placed inside my &amp;ldquo;office&amp;rdquo; (it&amp;rsquo;s more a hobby room than an office, but let&amp;rsquo;s keep pretending) and I spend a significant amount of time inside this room, I wanted a way to measure air quality in my room.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
